**🧠 Project:** Drug Response Prediction using Contrastive Learning and Gene Expression Embeddings
**📌 Task Summary:**

* Implemented a machine learning pipeline integrating contrastive learning with gene expression and drug molecular features.
* Added BioBERT-based textual embeddings for drug/gene enrichment.
* Refactored code to support efficient training and evaluation on benchmark pharmacogenomic datasets (GDSC, CCLE).
* Designed an A0 LaTeX poster for academic presentation.
* Documented the methodology and implementation steps clearly.
* Prepared content for submission or presentation in future conferences.

**🔧 Tools Used:** PyTorch, Transformers (BioBERT), Pandas, scikit-learn, LaTeX (for poster design)

**📈 Outcome:**

* A well-structured pipeline ready for experiments and performance benchmarking.
* A professional academic poster draft completed for future use.

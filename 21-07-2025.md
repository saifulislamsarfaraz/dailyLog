# 🗓️ Daily Log – 2025-07-21

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Learned and tested how to safely use `rsync` to copy specific folders between mounted drives.
- Understood the difference between GUI file transfer vs. `rsync` CLI performance.
- Verified that `rsync` does not delete source files unless explicitly instructed.
- Identified the best flags for **fast & safe** `rsync` copy:
  - `--info=progress2`
  - `--inplace`
  - `--no-whole-file`
  - `--stats`, etc.
- Compared transfer tools: `rsync` vs `cp` vs GUI copy.
- Asked and clarified about best practices for **logging daily system tasks**.
